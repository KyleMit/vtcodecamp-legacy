  <p>
    This page contains a list of primitive and composed UI components.  
    It's initially seeded from the Material UI Library, but hopes to 
    provide live examples, syntax, annotations, and descriptions of 
    each component and their intended use cases.

    but also provides a dedicated space to have conversations on design
    decisions.
